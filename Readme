Space Shooter Game - Tacos Invade
Overview

This is a simple space shooter game developed in Python using Pygame. It was my first Python project back in 2018. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that shoots bullets at an enemy (depicted as a taco). When a bullet hits the taco, it explodes, and the taco reappears in a random location on the screen.
Features

    Player-controlled spaceship that can move left and right.
    Space-themed background.
    Enemies (tacos) that appear at random positions.
    Bullets fired by the player's spaceship.
    Collision detection between bullets and enemies.
    Explosions that appear when bullets hit enemies.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Pygame

Setup

To set up the game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: Python Download. To install Pygame, run the following command:

pip install pygame

Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the game files and run the Python script. For example:

bash

cd path/to/game
python main.py

Controls

    Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship.
    Press the up arrow key to shoot bullets.

Assets

The game uses several image files for the spaceship, bullet, enemy, and explosion. These images are essential for the visual elements of the game.
Future Enhancements

This project is open to enhancements and improvements. Potential future updates include:

    Adding a scoring system.
    Introducing multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
    Implementing sound effects and background music.
    Creating a variety of enemies with different behaviors.
